#Write a function named first_non_repeating_letter† that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string. 
# For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string. 
# As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.
# If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("");

def first_non_repeating_letter(s=input("Insert string: ")):
    chars = s.lower()

            print(s[index]) #Debug
